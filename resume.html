        Hello! My name is Samer /ˈsɛː.mer/. I am a PhD candidate at the University of Antwerp, working in the <a href="https://www.bittremieux.be/" target="_blank" download="resume.pdf">Bittremieux Lab</a>. My current research focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence to uncover patterns in mass spectrometry data across repositories.

        My main research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and life sciences, specifically geometric deep learning, and recently Kolmogorov–Arnold networks. Previously, I worked in the field of Computer-Aided Drug Discovery at the Institut Pasteur.
