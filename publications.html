          <span class="abstract-title">Abstract:</span> Computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) is nurtured by late advances in big
          data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards enhanced drug discovery
          (DD) outcomes. In this context, reliable datasets are of utmost importance. We
          herein present CidalsDB a novel web server for AI-assisted DD against infectious pathogens, namely Leishmania parasites and Coronaviruses. We performed
          a literature search on molecules with validated anti-pathogen effects. Then, we
          consolidated these data with bioassays from PubChem. Finally, we constructed
          a database to store these datasets and make them accessible and ready-to-use
          for the scientific community through CidalsDB, a web-based interface. In a second step, we implemented and optimized four ML and one DL algorithms that
          optimally predict the biological activity of molecules. Random Forests (RF)
          and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were the best classifiers of anti-Leishmania
          molecules, while Gradient Boosting (GB) and Graph-Convolutional Network
          (GCN) achieved the best performances on the Coronaviruses dataset. All four
          models were optimized and deployed through CidalsDB as anti-pathogen activity prediction models. Scientific Contribution. CidalsDB is an open access
          web-based tool that allows browsing and access to ready-to-use datasets of antipathogen molecules, alongside best performing AI models for biological activity
          prediction. It offers a democratized no-code platform for AI-based CADD, which
          shall foster innovation and collaboration within the DD community. CidalsDB is
          accessible through  <a href="https://cidalsdb.streamlit.app" target="_blank">cidalsdb.streamlit.app</a>.

          <span class="abstract-title">Abstract:</span> Drug discovery is a resource-intensive process that involves extensive research and development to identify potential new drugs. Combining artificial intelligence approaches with bioinformatics can provide a cost-effective solution for accelerating this process. In this project, our focus is on featurizing molecules and implementing multiple machine learning models to classify molecules as potential drug candidates for Leishmania, a neglected tropical disease.
